## Welcome to The Night Forum Launcher

This is a UNIVERSAL launcher for any game. It automatically updates, downloads and will run any game.
This is the OFFICIAL Launcher the TNF (AKA: The Night Forum) uses for their games.

### Why?

When I built my first game, I remember trying to find a launcher that I could use to distrobute my game to the players quickly and easily. The problem i found, they were all built for specific games and only had features for those games.

With this launcher, it does everything. If you need a feature, request it.

### How to use for your game.

It is very easy to release your game with our launcher. All you have to do is create a pull request with a folder inside the /games directory of this project. Inside of that folder you need to have a zip file and a config file. All this can be achieved if you download our Game Packer. It will even give you the full instructions on how to Upload it.

Once you have uploaded your game, It will take us up to 1 day MAX to accept your pull. After that, just give the users the name of the folder you made.
From now on, that folder name is going to be a code.

### How to update my game.

So, you want to update your game? Re-Zip your game with the same name, push ur update. Go to the config file, and increase the game version.
